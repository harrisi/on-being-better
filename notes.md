(L24|my-anti-resume.md) TODO: ~~Maybe I can keep these to two categories? I might not need categories at all.~~ Maybe a kanban-style? Maybe hook into Trello? Maybe make my own Trello for this?

Should `list` be a raw list of items? It could also be a database which is the item with some more relevant information. Example:

| Item            | Directory | Items (recursively?) | Last updated |
| ----            | --------- | --------------------:|:------------:|
| Emacs           | Emacs     |                    1 |  2015-12-12  |
| Git             | git-scm   |                   15 |  2016-01-04  |
| REST            | REST      |                    0 |  2015-12-12  |

Although this is essentially just making a file system within git, within a file system, it could be useful? maybe?

I should have some hook/daemon/something that identifies duplicates.

Functional implementations of various things.
Things like "Baby's First Garbage Collector" (http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/12/08/babys-first-garbage-collector/) and other examples that mostly are written in an imperative style. It could be a series of examples written in different languages, both ones that embrace the functional style and those that aren't typically thought of as functional languages (Java, C#, even C?).

Ian is riding a taste sensation.
