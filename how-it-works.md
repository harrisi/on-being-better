# How it works

*This is mostly a meta file for my own sanity.*

My idea is to have each item in the list (<root>/list) have an associated directory to go along with it (in <root>/list-expansion/), as I expand on each item. Having this extra layer of abstraction means that I can have items in the list which have no directory, which means nothing has been done. Each time I add some new directory corresponding to an item in the list, I should link to it (I supppose this means having some hypertext version of this available for navigating). This also allows the scope of each item to be arbitrary and scalable.

To start, an example.
