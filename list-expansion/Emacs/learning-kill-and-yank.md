# Kill and Yank

One issue I ran into while trying to adopt Emacs was the inability to copy and paste as I also have. I couldn't just (to use Emacs-notation) C-x or C-c and then C-v. None of these do even close to what I was used to. Of course other keybindings that I was familiar with from other editors (Sublime Text, Notepad++, Visual Studio, etc.) were very different as well, but what I do most when coding is saving (C-x C-s isn't that hard of a change coming from C-s) and moving code around.

I would actually typically just use my mouse to highlight some text and, with any modern editor, just click and drag it like it was a unique object. Other than that, Shift-<directional arrows> and Ctrl-Shift-<directional arrows> would be used, and then C-x, click somewhere, C-v. I had gotten quite good at this form of editing, so I was reluctant to learn a new method. I still have trouble with some advanced features of killing and yanking, but I'm getting better.

Emacs' way of cutting and pasting (killing and yanking) is much nicer, in my opinion. I love the kill ring, although I hardly understand it. The basic way that I use it now is with just marking (C-SPC), moving around the buffer (C-a, C-e, C-n, C-p, etc.), killing (C-w), moving to the new spot, and yanking (C-y). This is not a very difficult change after relearning the commands for (what I still call) "cutting" and "pasting," and I know that there are many more useful options to learn.

One source of learning material I'm familiar with and should utilize is [Emacs Rocks!](http://emacsrocks.com).
