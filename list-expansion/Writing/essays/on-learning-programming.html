<h1 id="on-learning-programming-or-a-brief-history-of-me">On Learning Programming (or, A Brief History of Me)</h1>
<h2 id="i-am-not-a-programmer.">I am not a programmer.</h2>
<p>This is a sad realization for me. I have told myself for years now that I'm a programmer, but I am not. I don't know where I land in the spectrum of programming, if there is one. I've spent almost a decade now trying to be a programmer. There were a few points where I would actually consider myself a reasonably proficient programmer. As of writing this, I'm only 21 years old. I first was introduced to programming when I was about 11 or 12 years old. This was entirely something I got into myself as my family didn't really understand what I was doing and didn't want me to spend time on the computer. After a few years of learning on my own in a very helpful and supportive community, I got a job through a family friend programming. I was 16 when I first started getting paid to write code for a medical software startup, and it was pretty exciting. Unfortunately, I was so arrogant about making so much money (for my age and experience) that I figured I didn't need to finish high school. That job didn't last too long, and I ended up getting my GED (with honors!..).</p>
<p>After getting my GED I tried going to college several times, always giving up. My problem, at least how I interpreted the problem, was that I was so unfamiliar with having to spend time figuring out solutions to problems that I thought I wasn't cut out for college. In high school, as poor as my grades were, the material was largely easy to understand and I could usually figure out an answer in my head and without giving it much thought (math, science, etc.). College, as I've discovered, as not that way - especially not after being out of school for a few years. This was hard to accept, since I know a good amount of information about all sorts of things. But this isn't enough.</p>
<p>I've been involved in very few large projects. The medical software startup was definitely the largest codebase I've worked with, but it was, admittedly, rather basic. There wasn't anything too complex anywhere that I touched. I wrote some web apps, mobile apps, and did a small amount of work on a desktop application that just read data from USB. Since then the biggest thing I've done was write a wrapper for a Pascal library, implementing Python FFI support. This was fun, useful, and interesting, but really straightforward. It probably would've been faster and safer to just write a quick script to export everything in the library to have better C-like calling conventions, but everything is 20/20 in retrospect and all.</p>
<p>My biggest issue with everything I've worked on is that it's always 100% abandoned. This is my biggest failure in my life so far, I believe. I have had plenty of half-finished projects that sit and go nowhere after I get some basic functionality working, never to work on any of the complex (and more interesting) problems of the project. I would typically tell myself something about how a rewrite or a different language or the perfect framework or a new project would make the first project Betterâ„¢. I now know that this is just me procrastinating. I hope to change this, and I hope to finish more projects.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-learn-to-program">Learning to Learn to Program</h2>
<p>In the last 10 years, I've done a reasonable amount of learning, programming, and research - at least for not having any real formal education and not ever getting paid for it (other than the one job for several months). It's been entirely a hobby, although it's the only thing I've continued to be interested in as I've grown up. I can't ever get enough. I read blog posts, source code, white papers, talk to people with master's degrees in CS and PhD's in physics, and think about everything from language design to operating design to web applications to lambda calculus and more. A significant portion of my life has been dedicated to thinking about computers and computing. However, I've never committed myself to the application of this knowledge, and it continually fades from memory. I don't have much to show for all the reading I've done on the subject.</p>
<p>With this project (&quot;On Being Better&quot;), I'm trying to change this. I've always told myself that, since, for example, I've read The Dragon Book, every problem I face should be easy! Everyone considers The Dragon Book to be a book heavy on theory, which means I'm smarter than this problem! It'll be a piece of cake! But then I have to think about a problem for a short while and give up. My internal timer for how long any problem of any difficulty should take is approximately 1-60s. This is, to anyone who knows anything about programming, absurd.</p>
<p>Because of this, I've been trying to have more reasonable goals. For example, I'm going back to college (I start in three weeks as of writing this). This should hopefully be humbling, as I've mentally placed myself much higher above the classes I'm taking. I've also been preparing for the past few months by taking a course online on functional programming in ocaml (which I currently have a 64% in - I haven't gotten much work done on the final project. The course has proven to be much more difficult than I anticipated), as well as doing math problems on Khan Academy. Along with these I've been taking a course on functional programming taught by Erik Meijer on edx, and watching videos on MIT OCW (6.006) to practice note taking.</p>
<p>Today I got an annoucement from my CS 160 teacher for the coming term. The annoucement was about making sure a program could run before the course so that any issues could be solved before the course started. It's a program for learning programming and is pretty basic. All it is is a programmable environment for having a robot do basic tasks. Immediately it reminded me of the LEGO robotics I did in elementary school. None of this is new to me, and none of it is very interesting. In the past I would've just blown it off as unimportant and not done it, but now I'm actually doing all the problems. (I can't imagine the professor actually wants me to be finished with the whole course in one night, but oh well. I guess I'll just do everything twice.)</p>
<p>I believe this is important. I'm sure I'm missing on a lot of key basic ideas that will be very beneficial to relearn (or learn for the first time). It probably won't be a very interesting time for me. My heart is in more complex problems, but my brain is incapable of doing anything about it. I hope in the years to come to be able to be one of those people who writes about a &quot;toy C compiler written in a month outside of work,&quot; or a &quot;quick LISP implementation written over a weekend.&quot; But those are goals I cannot yet follow through with today.</p>
<p>Until then, I will keep on making this robot pick up objects, rotate, move, and place them elsewhere. Wish me luck.</p>
