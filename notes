Should `list` be a raw list of items? It could also be a database which is the item with some more relevant information. Example:

| Item            | Directory | Items (recursively?) | Last updated |
| ----            | --------- | --------------------:|:------------:|
| Emacs           | Emacs     |                    1 |  2015-12-12  |
| Git             | git-scm   |                   15 |  2016-01-04  |
| REST            | REST      |                    0 |  2015-12-12  |

Although this is essentially just making a file system within git, within a file system, it could be useful? maybe?

I should have some hook/daemon/something that identifies duplicates.
