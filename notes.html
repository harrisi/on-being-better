<p>(L24|my-anti-resume.md) TODO: <del>Maybe I can keep these to two categories? I might not need categories at all.</del> Maybe a kanban-style? Maybe hook into Trello? Maybe make my own Trello for this?</p>
<p>Should <code>list</code> be a raw list of items? It could also be a database which is the item with some more relevant information. Example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">Item</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Directory</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">Items (recursively?)</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Last updated</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Emacs</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Emacs</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">2015-12-12</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Git</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">git-scm</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">15</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">2016-01-04</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">REST</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">REST</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">0</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">2015-12-12</td>
</tr>

<p>Although this is essentially just making a file system within git, within a file system, it could be useful? maybe?</p>
<p>I should have some hook/daemon/something that identifies duplicates.</p>
<p>Functional implementations of various things.<br />Things like &quot;Baby's First Garbage Collector&quot; (<a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/12/08/babys-first-garbage-collector/" class="uri">http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/12/08/babys-first-garbage-collector/</a>) and other examples that mostly are written in an imperative style. It could be a series of examples written in different languages, both ones that embrace the functional style and those that aren't typically thought of as functional languages (Java, C#, even C?).</p>
<p>Ian is riding a taste sensation.</p>
<p>I'd like to set up mirrors on bitbucket and possibly gitlab.</p>
<p>I'd like to start using GitHub Issues for some things. I don't know how this works in with having mirrors as noted above.</p>
<p>I want to figure out a way to potentially break off certain projects to standalone repos (such as the VM implemented in Python). It's important I keep git history with the project (does this mean I'll need to manually select relevant commits or something? How would this work?).</p>
